# Footfall Analytics

## Overview

This reposity contains jupyter notebooks designed to analyse pedestrian traffic patterns using advanced data processing techniques. This repository provides a framework for collecting, processing, and visualizing footfall data to gain insights into public behaviour, peak traffic times, and spatial distribution.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Supports data sources provide by the BT (British Telecommunications) Group made avaialble through the GLA (Greater London Authority).

- **Preprocessing**: Cleans, models, normalizes, and structures raw data for analysis.

- **Analytics & Insights**: Generates datasets to produce heatmaps in ArcGIS and identifies traffic patterns through trend analysis.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/footfall-analytics.git

   cd footfall-analytics

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```sh

   python main.py

   ```

## Usage

- Upload or stream footfall data from your preferred source.

- Configure parameters for preprocessing and analysis.

- View interactive visualizations on the dashboard.

- Export reports for further business intelligence.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python

- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, personally tailored functions and more.
